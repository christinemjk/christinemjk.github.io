	<p>People are multifaceted. Shouldn't your style reflect that?</p>

	<h2>Rock</h2>
	<p>I know that some days, I want to dress like a total badass, "Hey, I'm headed skydiving. Yeah, I'm jumping out of a plane." Other days, hipster-grunge, anyone else hitting up that warehouse party in Brooklyn?</p>

	<section id="rose">
	<h2>Rose</h2>
	<p>Back home in Annapolis, going out on the boat, prep me out. Headed to the office for a meeting, classy and corporate with feminine touches, gold jewelry, and a blazer.</p>

	<h2>Rock x Rose</h2>
	<p>It's not even always the place you're headed, but the mood you're in. Some days, I just want to brood and wear all black graphic tees, some days I want to smile and shine like the sun in all sorts of colors. The point is, rarely are people just one type of look. I wanted a brand that supports and represents that. Don't feel stuck in one style because you're scared you can't "pull off" that look. You can pull it off and you will rock it.</p>

	<h2>Soul</h2>
	<p>Let us inspire you to try different looks for any venue, mood, and state of mind. Remember, you're a unique individual with the right to express yourself in many ways. Embrace every piece of your personality. You are strong and beautiful; you are a rock and a rose.</p>
