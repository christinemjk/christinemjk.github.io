		<p id="slogan">Create to permeate the minds of our kind...</p>

		<p>Christine's Creations is a snippet of my life's work thus far, as I continue to trek through the world of the creative, one snapshot, excerpt, thought, and idea at a time. 
		<br>
		My only hope is to spread the message of a simple notion, as J.D. Salinger so brilliantly wrote, "And it isn't education. It's history. It's poetry."</p>
